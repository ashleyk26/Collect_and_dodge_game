# Collect and Dodge 2D Game

### Ashley Kulcsar and Nick Pleva

**How to Play:**
- You are a blue box that is controlled using the arrow keys
- You must collect the purple boxes (the supplies) by moving to overlap each
- There are enemies that you must avoid. They are the red boxes, and their spawn locations are randomized throughout the map. They either move up and down or left and right
- You have 3 lives, represented by the battery icon in the top left. The "charge" slowly goes down as you lose those lives
- There is a safe-zone in which you spawn in. It starts on the left side of the screen and spans about 60 pixels wide. Nothing can spawn or move into that zone the entire game
- There are 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Death.
- After you either win or lose, you can click r and be taken to the screen in which you choose your difficulty
